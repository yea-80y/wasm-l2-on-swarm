🐝 WASM L2 on Swarm
A prototype for building a Layer 2 logic engine on top of Ethereum Swarm, using WebAssembly (WASM) modules to validate content stored in Swarm’s base layer (DISC — Distributed Immutable Store of Chunks).
This project demonstrates how logic can be stored on Swarm, loaded dynamically, and executed client-side — enabling a fully decentralized compute model without needing a blockchain for every operation.
________________________________________
✅ What It Does
•	Stores profile data (JSON) on Swarm
•	Uploads WASM validator logic to Swarm
•	Runs that logic client-side to validate the data
•	Executes Layer 2 behavior entirely on top of Swarm (DISC)
________________________________________
🧠 Why This Matters
This is an early step toward a truly decentralized app architecture:
•	Data lives on Swarm (immutable and persistent)
•	Logic lives on Swarm (WASM modules)
•	Validation runs on the client (trustless execution)
•	No centralized backend or blockchain compute required

🚀 Run Locally (No Build Tools Needed)
1.	Open in VS Code
2.	Install the Live Server extension
3.	Right-click index.html → Open with Live Server
4.	Update the script with your profile.json Swarm hash
5.	✅ See real-time WASM validation of Swarm-hosted data

🛠 Build the WASM Module (Rust)
1.	Install Rust
2.	Install wasm-pack:
perl
CopyEdit
cargo install wasm-pack
3.	Build the module:
pgsql
CopyEdit
cd wasm-validator
wasm-pack build --target web
4.	Copy pkg/wasm_validator_bg.wasm and wasm_validator.js to the root directory.

🐝 Uploading to Swarm
To upload the WASM or profile JSON to your Bee node:
nginx
CopyEdit
curl -X POST ^
  -H "Swarm-Postage-Batch-Id: <your-batch-id>" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" ^
  --data-binary "@wasm_validator_bg.wasm" ^
  http://bee.swarm.public.dappnode:1633/bzz

🔮 What's Next
This project is the first step toward a Swarm-native Layer 2 protocol stack.
Future plans include:
•	✅ Message board logic (Reddit-style validation of posts/comments)
•	✅ Swarm Feed-based logic versioning
•	✅ Profile creation and moderation rules in WASM
•	✅ Fully autonomous Swarm-hosted applications
This project evolves into a decentralized Reddit, and eventually:
“The only app we’ll ever need.”
